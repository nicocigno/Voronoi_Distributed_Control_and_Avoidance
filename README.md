# Voronoi_Distributed_Control_and_Avoidance

This project presents the implementation of
a Voronoi-Based algorithm for the distributed control
within a given sensing range and exploration of an unknown
mission space with static and dynamic obstacles.
The various steps are presented starting from the theory
behind these algorithms up to the realization of the final
tasks, one for static obstacle avoidance and the other
for collaboration between robots equipped with global
sensors and relative sensors to detect possible static and
dynamic obstacles and to find an unknown target object.
Sources of artificial noise on the position and detection
of the robots are added to the measurements so that
the state could then be estimated with the use of a
Kalman Filter. Finally, the performance and limits of
the algorithms are presented and analyzed.
